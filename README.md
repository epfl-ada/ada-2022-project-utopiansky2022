# Study on Representation in Cinema
___Utopiansky2022: Arthur Ardelea, Camille , Nerea, Nico___



## Abstract
Art imitates life and life imitates art - Cinema has the power to capture the zeitgeist of an era. In this project we will be studying representation in cinema to better understand trends in societal sentiments. This project is motivated by the understanding that the 20th century was a time of dynamic social upheavel and mobility - In Switzerland, womens sufferage at the federal level was granted as late as 1971. 
This project is based on the CMU Movie Summary Corpus Datasets. It is predicated on the idea that character portrayal in cinema serves as a mirror for the society which gave rise to the character. Notable focus will be placed on analysis by gender. Character focused analysis will lean heavily on Stanfords NLP library in order to understand lexical groups by which characters are defined. 


## Research Questions
The following questions will serve to scope and guide our efforts during the course of our analysis:
* How can we differentiate between depictions of male and female characters? 
    + How do they act? How do others act unto them?
    + What do they say? What do others say about them?
    + How are they described? 
    + What set of roles and professions do they occupy?
* Can we extract archetypes / stereotypes across genders through lexical analysis?
* Are women frequently less complex characters? Are women underrepresented? 
* What is the prevelence of m/f characters?
* Is there a discrepency in age between m/f characters? are senior women under-represented?

* Do all of the arformentioned questions show an evolution over time? Do they show discernable differences across geographies?  


## Proposed additional datasets
