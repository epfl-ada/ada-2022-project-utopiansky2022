## Study on Representation in Cinema
___Utopiansky2022: Arthur Ardelea, Camille , Nerea, Nico___



## Abstract:
Art imitates life and life imitates art - Cinema has the effortless power to capture the zeitgeist of an era. In this project we will be studying representation in cinema over time to better understand how general societal sentiment may have changed in the last odd century. This project is motivated by the understanding that the 20th century was a time of dynamic social upheavel and mobility. In the United States, Jim Crowe laws citing 'seperate but equal races' existed into the 1960's. In Switzerland, womens sufferage at the federal level was granted as late as 1971. Our conclusions are predicated on the idea that by understanding how one is represented in cinema, we are informed on the society which gave rise to the character. Notable focus will be placed on analysis by gender because ???????

interesting thought - idea of quotas in modern movies now breaking away from a once natural reflection/process


## Research Questions: 
The following questions will serve to scope and guide our efforts during the course of this project:
\begin{itemize}
   \item How are m/f characters characterized? Can NLP be useful for this?
   \begin{itemize}
      \item How do they comport themselves? 
      \itemWhat do they say?
      \item What do they think?
      \itemHow do they act?
      \item profession?
   \end{itemize}   
   \item Can we extract archetypes / stereotypes across genders through lexical analysis?
   \item Are women less complex characters? Are women underrepresented?
   \item What is the prevelence of m/f characters?

   \item Is there a discrepency in age between m/f characters? are senior women under-represented
   \item Do all of the arformentioned questions show an evolution over time? Do they show discernable differences across geographies?
\end{itemize}   


## Proposed additional datasets (if any):
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that youâ€™ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

There are no additional datasets being considered.


## Methods:
The bulk of our data wrangling/processing occurs with the stanford NLP library. 


## Proposed timeline:
* 11/18         : P2 due
* 11/18 - 12/2  : Homework 2 interregnum 
* 12/3  - 12/4  : Explore Simple and Complex Website options
* 12/4  - 12/11 : Data analysis
* 12/4  - 12/18 : Build out website wireframe and populate as results come in
